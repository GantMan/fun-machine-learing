# How to Contribute
Please add your content in the appropriate section, upload an image, and start your title with :arrow_forward: so we can clearly see where each blog begins/ends.  Once your addition has been made, I suggest running `doctoc` to update the header table of contents.

### How to install and use `doctoc`

Install via npm with `npm i -g doctoc` and then run `doctoc .` in the root folder to properly update the table of contents to fit new content.
